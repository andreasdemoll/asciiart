-----------

python project to convert photos into asciiart. Reads in a JPG foto and saves a PNG which consists of differnet charachters, each with different brightness.

current status and todo:
* implement _better_ interface by using command line interface with the python module that creates the cli from __doc__ via import docopt and reading the paramters.
* implement _better_ scaling scheme, that uses **number of ascii characters** of the longest side of the pic as an input.
* add documentation to all functions and use better interfaces.
