asciiart
========

description
-----------

python project to convert photos into asciiart. Generates ascii-art from images. A given \*.jpg file is converted to an ascii-art \*.png file and stored.

current status and todo:
* add parameter check for all paramters (type and range).
* make it run faster by avoiding loops.
* add documentation to all functions.
* register the script as standard function in Linux that can be called from everywhere.
* maybe colored 'asciiart' support.
