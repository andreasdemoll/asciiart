asciiart
========

description
-----------

python project to convert photos into asciiart. Generates ascii-art from images. A given \*.jpg file is converted to an ascii-art \*.png file and stored.


current status and ideas
------------------------
* make a version with destination file as parameter.
* make a requirements.txt for all used packages.
* make it run faster by avoiding loops.
* register the script as standard function in Linux.
* maybe colored 'asciiart' support.
