asciiart
========

description
-----------

python project to convert photos into asciiart. Generates ascii-art from images. A given \*.jpg file is converted to an ascii-art \*.png file and stored.

current status and todo:
* use the docopt interface to supply the packages internal variables. What is the best way?
* add documentation to all functions.
* delete the input and output folders and register the script as standard function in Linux that can be called from everywhere.
* add background color definition and colored 'asciiart' support.
